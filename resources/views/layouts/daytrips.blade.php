                                Arusha National Park Covers Mount Meru, a prominent volcano with an elevation of 4566 m,
                                in
                                the Arusha Region of north eastern Tanzania.
                                The park is small but varied with spectacular landscapes in three distinct areas. In the
                                west, the Meru Crater funnels the Jekukumia River;
                                the peak of Mount Meru lies on its rim. Ngurdoto Crater in the south-east is grassland.
                                The
                                shallow alkaline Momella Lakes in the north-east
                                have varying algal colours and are known for their wading birds.
                                Mount Meru is the second highest peak in Tanzania after Mount Kilimanjaro, which is just
                                60
                                km away and forms a backdrop
                                to views from the park to the east. Arusha National Park lies on a 300-kilometre axis of
                                Africa's most famous national parks,
                                running from Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater in the west to Kilimanjaro National Park in
                                the
                                east.
                                The park is just a few kilometres north east of Arusha, though the main gate is 25 km
                                east
                                of the city. It is also 58 km from Moshi and 35 km
                                from Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA).
                                Wildlife
                                Arusha National Park has a rich variety of wildlife, but visitors shouldn't expect the
                                same
                                game-viewing experience they find in other national parks of Tanzania's
                                northern circuit. Despite the small size of the park, common animals include giraffe,
                                Cape
                                buffalo, zebra, warthog, the black-and-white colobus monkey, the blue monkey,
                                flamingo, elephant, bushbuck and many other African animals. Leopard populations are
                                present, but rarely seen. Birdlife in the forest is prolific, with many forest species
                                more easily seen here than elsewhere on the tourist route - Narina trogon and bar-tailed
                                trogon are both possible highlights for visiting birders, whilst the range of
                                starling species provide somewhat less gaudy interest.

                                Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. Chemka means
                                "boiling" in Swahili, referring to the appearance of how the water emerges from the
                                ground. <br>

                                The drive to Kikuletwa Hotsprings will start in the morning (depending on your
                                location). After driving on the main road and hopefully catching a glimpse of mount
                                Kilimanjaro, we’ll leave the main road and exchange it for an adventurous off-road path,
                                straight into no man’s land. The road will take you through gorgeous African country
                                side, past bush land, dry riverbeds, baobab and acacia trees. This vast area is home to
                                members of many different tribes, which we will pass by on our way over to the Kikuletwa
                                Hotsprings.

                                Once arrived at the hotsprings, you can swim, ropeswing, explore, relax and enjoy the
                                beautiful green oasis. You can rent snorkling goggles to overview the underwater-world
                                and search for hiding turtles. If you’d like to relax, put out your towel, order a
                                coconut or even have a very local massage.

                                The Kikuletwa Hotsprings is home to one very specific type of fish, named the Garra Rufa
                                fish. If that doesn’t ring a bell, it’s those fish they use for pedicures that eat the
                                dead skin off of your feet! The Rungudai Hot Springs is their natural habitat, so don’t
                                be scared if you feel something nibbling on your feet. Just sit back, relax and enjoy
                                the free pedicure. Outside of the hotsprings people actually pay a lot of money for this
                                treatment, but here it’s completely free! There’s also a chance to find turtles and
                                catfish in the hotsprings

                                        tree-climbing lions a particular treat. These proud predators lounge in acacia

                                        practically begging to be photographed.
                                        Bird-watchers will find Lake Manyara is an absolute delight, with a huge variety
                                        of

                                <strong>Lake Chala</strong>, also known as Lake Challa, is a crater lake that straddles
                                the border between Kenya and Tanzania. The lake formed approximately 250,000 years ago.
                                The lake is east of Mount <strong>Kilimanjaro</strong>, 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) north of
                                Taveta, Kenya, and 55 kilometres (34 mi) east of Rombo District. The lake is surrounded
                                by a steep crater rim with a maximum height of 170 metres (560). <br>
                                <strong>Lake Chala Safari Camp</strong> is a beautiful private game reserve overlooking

                                through vividly green
                                flora, with the blue, blue lake ahead of you. It gets quite rocky near the lake so wear
                                sturdy footwear. It’s a stunning area perfect for hikers and birdwatchers, and in season
                                you might be lucky enough to spot elephants gathering at a distant waterhole. Spend the
                                day wandering the paths around the lake or across the nearby savannah, where you’re
                                likely to see baboons,
                                vervet monkeys and blue monkeys as well as (perhaps) the shy dik-dik and graceful kudu,
                                too. <br>
                                After your hike, spend some time sitting by the lakeside enjoying the stillness, only
                                disturbed by birdsong and the gently lapping waters.
                                If you’re feeling a little more active, you can jump into a kayak and explore the lake
                                further. You’ll be serenaded by the ever-present birdsong and gentle plashing of the
                                water as you row. <br>
                                <strong>After Your Adventure:</strong> you’ll be driven back to Moshi in the late
                                afternoon. The pleasant drive will give “you” some time to reflect on your day and
                                wonder if it would be rude to
                                go straight to bed when you get back – you won’t believe how tired you’ll feel after a
                                day of restorative, stress-relieving peace.

                                <strong>The Maasai: A Resilient People with a Rich History</strong> <br>
                                The Maasai are a semi-nomadic tribe of people who live in Kenya and Tanzania. They have
                                a long and complex history, dating back centuries.
                                Some historians believe that the Maasai are descended from a group of warriors who
                                migrated from the Nile Valley in the 16th century.
                                Others believe that they are the descendants of a group of Nilotic people who migrated
                                from the north in the 13th century.
                                Regardless of their origins, the Maasai have a strong and distinct cultural identity.
                                They have a rich cultural heritage that is reflected in their music, dance, and art.
                                They also have a deep connection to their traditions and customs . <br>
                                The Maasai are an inspiration to us all. They show us that it is possible to preserve
                                our culture and traditions even in the face of great challenges. They are a reminder
                                that we should never give up on our dreams, no matter how difficult they may seem.

                                    The Maasai Diet: A Rich and Varied Diet Based on Livestock
                                </strong>
                                <br>
                                The Maasai are a semi-nomadic tribe of people who live in Kenya and Tanzania. They have
                                a rich and varied diet that is based on livestock.
                                In addition to milk, blood, and meat, the Maasai also eat a variety of other foods,
                                including honey, vegetables, and fruits. Honey is a valuable source of sugar and other
                                nutrients. Vegetables and fruits are typically eaten during the rainy season, when they
                                are more abundant.
                                The Maasai diet is a healthy and balanced diet that provides them with all the nutrients
                                they need. The diet is also low in fat and cholesterol.
                                In recent years, the Maasai have begun to supplement their diet with farm crops such as
                                maize meal, rice, and cabbage. This is due to the increasing scarcity of grazing land
                                and the need for a more reliable food source.
                                Overall, the Maasai diet is an integral part of their way of life and reflects their
                                deep connection to their livestock and the land. If you are interested in learning more
                                about the Maasai diet, I encourage you to visit a Maasai village or explore the many
                                resources available online. You will be amazed by the richness and complexity of this
                                diet
