                            Park. We arrive in time for lunch at the lodge/Tented Camp/Campsite and after lunch we head
                            into the Lake Manyara National Park for an afternoon game drive. This National Park is one of
                            Tanzania’s most dramatically located wildlife areas, consisting of a massive but shallow soda
                            lake
                            (covering two-thirds of the park), located at the foot of the Great Rift Valley’s western
                            escarpment. The Park’s
                            varied habitat attracts a wide variety of animals, including one of Africa’s largest
                            concentrations of Elephants
                            ; Lake Manyara is unique for a Tree-climbing Lions, as well as large flocks of Flamingos
                            attracted by the algae
                            in the lake. Dinner and overnight at the Hotel/Tented Camp/Lodge/Basic Campsite.

                            After the breakfast we will drive to the shores of Lake Eyasi. You will arrive in time for lunch
                            at the Lodge/Campsite. Lake Eyasi is a very scenic soda Lake found on the Southern border of the
                            Ngorongoro
                            Conservation Area. This less visited lake lies at the base of the Eyasi escarpment on the
                            Western Rift Valley Wall. This afternoon you will be introduced to the extraordinary people who
                            belong to an indigenous tribe known as the ‘Hadzabee’ (hunter-gatherer Bushmen). The tribe
                            inhabits the shores of Lake Eyasi as do the Nilotic-speaking Datoga tribe. You will visit these
                            tribes, which will include a visit to their homesteads, learn about their way of life, animal
                            tracking, medicinal plants, and much more. Some wildlife and a wide range of bird species can be
                            viewed during walks around the lake, which can be arranged. Return for dinner and overnight at
                            Tented Camp/ Lodge/Luxury/Basic Campsite.

                            This is not a mere performance. The Bushmen rely on these techniques to survive and you’ll need
                            to be very attentive
                            and at times quiet, while they demonstrate their use of locally made poisons in incapacitating

                            official entrance, which then drops into the Park’s signature wide-open plains. Like no other,
                            this
                            stretch embodies the meaning of the word “Serengeti,” which derives from the Masai “Siringet”

                            has been artistically translated as “the land that flows on forever”. Serengeti National Park

                            second largest National Park, covers nearly 6,000 square miles of grassland plains, Savannah,
                            kopjes, hills,
                            woodlands, and Riverine forests. The Grumeti, Mbalageti, and Mara river systems serve as
                            critical water sources
                            and are often excellent sites for wildlife viewing. Beyond the heralded migration of wildebeest
                            and zebra,
                            the Serengeti is best known for its big predators, including cheetah and Leopard, as well as
                            large prides
                            of Lions and clans of Hyenas. Other commonly seen animals include gazelle, Buffalo, giraffe,
                            Topi,
                            Hartebeest, Ostrich, and Jackal, but it is the full diversity of wildlife and habitats that you
                            will truly
                            find amazing. The greater Serengeti ecosystem actually covers the Ngorongoro Conservation Area,
                            the Masai
                            Mara in Kenya, and numerous surrounding wildlife-protected lands that combine for a total of
                            almost 17,000
                            square miles, which is larger than the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island
                            all together.
